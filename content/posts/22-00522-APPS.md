This appeal challenged the response of [22-02530-FOIA][22-02530-FOIA]. The response stated the request was not seeking records and FOIA was not an appropriate venue for questions.

The appeal response partially agreed with the FOIA office, but did provide some information.

Highlight:

> In considering your appeal, I have determined that two parts of your request properly
seek SEC records: (1) your request for a “count or count estimates of shares of GameStop held
by retail investors;” and (2) your request for “a list of broker-dealers responsible for the
transactions that have failed to deliver.” Based on searches conducted by various offices within
the SEC, I have determined that there are no SEC records reflecting a “count or count estimates
of shares of GameStop held by retail investors.” With regard to second part, although the SEC
does not maintain a specific “list of broker-dealers responsible for the transactions that have
failed to deliver,” the FOIA Office directed you to a link on the SEC’s website that contains
information on [fails to deliver in securities data][ftds].
