#### April 13, 2021

[Commissioner Hester Peirce][hp] releases Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0 [statement][hp-statement] - [github][hp-github]

#### May 11, 2021

An article titled ["The Future Of Tokenized Stocks - What They Can Replace And What To Watch Out For"][tokenized-article] is released.

This article was edited [about a month later][tokenized-article-edited] to more prominently feature SBF.

#### May 12, 2021

Ryan Cohen posted [this tweet][rc-va-tweet] from Arlington, VA GameStop which [is a 12 minute drive][va-sec-drive] to the SEC.

[Tokenized GME stocks are issued.][tokenized-issued]

#### May 13, 2021

There is a [Closed Commission Meeting][ccmeeting].

#### Sometime Between May and October

I stumbled across this SEC regulation about [closed Commission meetings][ccmeeting-reg].

I was new to the FOIA process at the time of request, and missed the window for appeal. I submitted an identical request in 2022 that resulted in [22-03086-FOIA][22-03086-FOIA] which was [appealed][23-00004-APPS].
