The SEC gathers and publishes information about institutional owners of stocks, but provides 0 information about retail ownership. I submitted this request seeking information about retail ownership of GameStop.

I received a fairly canned response telling me to search company filings.

This request/response triggered a more detailed [22-02530-FOIA][22-02530-FOIA] which was [appealed][22-00522-APPS].
