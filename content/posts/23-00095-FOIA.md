Gary Gensler has [another interview with Jon Stewart][gg-js] and pretends to be uninformed about retail investors direct registering their shares of GameStop.

I requested "any and all emails to, from, cc'd, or bcc'd with Gary Genser containing keywords 'computershare' or 'DRS'".

There has not been a response to this request. This request was [appealed][23-00041-APPS] for not having a response in a timely manner.
