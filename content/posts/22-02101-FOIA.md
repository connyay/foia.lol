This request is for costs associated with the four-part "Investomania" video series the SEC produced: [Crypto][crypto-vid], [Margin][margin-vid], [Easy Money][easymoney-vid], [Meme Stocks][memestocks-vid].

This series came out at the wrong time, about three months after [Gary Gensler appeared on The Problem][theprob] and mentioned SEC staffers taking donations for coffee in the office.

The SEC acknowledged this request on June 1st and responded on September 20th. 111 days. 76 work days.

The response documents show the SEC spent $366,205 on production and advertising for this series.
