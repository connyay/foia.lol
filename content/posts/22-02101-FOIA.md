The SEC produced a four part video series titled "Investomania". [Crypto][crypto-vid], [Margin][margin-vid], [Easy Money][easymoney-vid], [Meme Stocks][memestocks-vid].

This series came out at a particularly bad time. This was about three months after [Gary Gensler appeared on The Problem][theprob] and mentioned SEC staffers taking donations for coffee in the office.

Why is the SEC spending $366,205 producing and advertising this series while asking staffers to donate coffee to drink in the office?

Request acknowledged on June 1st and response received on September 20th. 111 days. 76 work days.
