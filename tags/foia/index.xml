Crypto, Margin, Easy Money, Meme Stocks.
This series came out at a particularly bad time. This was about three months after Gary Gensler appeared on The Problem and mentioned SEC staffers taking donations for coffee in the office.
Why is the SEC spending $366,205 producing and advertising this series while asking staffers to donate coffee to drink in the office?</description></item><item><title>22-01697-FOIA</title><link>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</guid><description>The SEC gathers and publishes information about institutional owners of stocks, but provides 0 information about retail ownership. I submitted this request seeking information about retail ownership of GameStop.
I received a fairly canned response telling me to search company filings.
This request/response triggered a more detailed 22-02530-FOIA which was appealed.
